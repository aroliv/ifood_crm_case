# Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains the code and presentation slides for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) case study. The case study focuses on analyzing customer data to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Contents

1. **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook file contains the code used for data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, feature selection using VIF, and logistic regression modeling.

2. **Presentation**: The presentation slides provide an overview of the case study, including the problem statement, data analysis insights, modeling approach, results, and recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this case study contains information about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and response to marketing campaigns. It includes features such as age, income, education level, and history of purchases and campaign responses.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and preprocess variables, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

3. **Clustering**: Perform clustering using K-means to group customers based on their similarities and identify distinct segments in the data.

4. **Feature Selection**: Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify multicollinearity among features and select relevant features for modeling.

5. **Model Building**: Train a logistic regression model to predict customer response to marketing campaigns based on the selected features.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the logistic regression model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

7. **Interpretability**: Interpret the logistic regression model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on customer response.

## Results and Recommendations

- Provide insights into customer behavior, preferences, and characteristics that influence campaign response.
- Recommend strategies for improving marketing effectiveness, targeting high-potential customers, and reducing campaign costs.

## Presentation

The presentation slides summarize key findings, insights, and recommendations from the case study. They are designed to communicate the results effectively to stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Future Work

- Explore additional machine learning algorithms and techniques for predictive modeling.
- Incorporate external data sources for a more comprehensive analysis and predictive power.
- Continuously monitor and update the CRM strategy based on ongoing customer insights and feedback.
